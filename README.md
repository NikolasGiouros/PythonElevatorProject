# Elevator Simulation Project

This project is an evacuation simulation plan that models the movement of an elevator in a building with multiple floors during an evacuation scenario. The goal is to efficiently transport residents between floors until the elevator reaches an empty state on the roof.

## Algorithms Used
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Project Structure
- `elevator_simulation.py`: Main script containing the elevator simulation functions.
- ...

## How to Run
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/elevator-simulation.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd elevator-simulation`
4. Run the script: `python elevator_simulation.py`
5. Follow on-screen instructions.
